# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The issue arises when the `express.json()` middleware is either missing or incorrectly configured, resulting in the application failing to parse the incoming JSON data.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js code attempts to handle POST requests containing JSON data.  However, due to a misconfiguration, `req.body` remains undefined within the request handler, preventing the application from processing the expected data.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `express.json()` middleware is correctly placed within the application's middleware stack, *before* the route handler that expects JSON data.
